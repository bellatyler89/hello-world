What you need to know about Gabriella Hernandez
I am a 26 up and coming Computer programmer, I am currently enrolled in my local community college to pursue my degree in Computer Programming A.A.S. In my free time I enjoy learning more about the numerous programming languages by practicing on Code Academy. My goal is to be accepted into App Academy. This is a goal I must accomplish, because I will work harder than any fellow classmates at the App Academy, because an opportunity like this will change my families life.
